Northwind Example (e2e-nwind)
-----------------------------

This e2e example showcases scenarios like data integration of Northwind and Superstore data,
how to edit out-of-the-box code when using embedded instances, versioning scenario where the
database has 2 versions each of the descriptor, instance-generator xqy module, schema, tde 
template etc.


`./gradlew rune2eNwind` runs the examples loader.

This example performs the following steps, to show how to use the Java Client
API to load data from two disparate sources and then harmonize it:


* Loads documents "as-is" from the `data` directory.  When this step is
  complete, the database will have lots of JSON documents as staged data.
* Loads some RDF reference data.
* Loads csv data(Superstore). When this step is complete, the database
 will have lots of JSON documents as staged data.
* Invokes an in-place transform batch on the raw documents to "harmonize".  This transform
 invokes code generated by Entity Services to wrap the JSON documents and store
 them in their canonical format.
* Upconverts envelopes generated from version 1, based on version 2 of the descriptor
