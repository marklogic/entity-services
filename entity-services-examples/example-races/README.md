Races Example (example-races)
-----------------------------

`../gradlew runEampleRaces` runs the examples loader.

This example performs the following steps, to show how to use the Java Client
API to load data from two disparate sources and then harmonize it:


* Loads documents "as-is" from the `data` directory.  When this step is
  complete, the database will have lots of JSON documents as staged data.
* Loads some RDF reference data.
* Invokes an in-place transform batch on the raw documents.  This transform
 invokes code generated by Entity Services to wrap the JSON documents and store
 them in their canonical format.
