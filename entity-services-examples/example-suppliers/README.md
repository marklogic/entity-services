Suppliers Example (example-suppliers)
-------------------------------------

This example uses Entity Services to emulate a relational schema familiar to database students from Wikipedia[1]

Running this example generates some TDE views and data from a given model.

```bash
./gradlew -exampleDir=example-suppliers runExampleSuppliers
```

Once you have run the example code, simply import the QConsole workspace
provide and you will see some SQL queries and Optic API expressions to help
you explore the data.
