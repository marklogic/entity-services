Suppliers Example (example-suppliers)
-------------------------------------

This example uses Entity Services to emulate a relational schema familiar to database students from Wikipedia[1]

Running this example generates some TDE views and data from a given model.

```bash
./gradlew -exampleDir=example-suppliers runExampleSuppliers
```

Once you have run the example code, simply import the QConsole workspace
provide and you will see some SQL queries and Optic API expressions to help
you explore the data.

This example uses JSON envelopes, which are new for 9.0-3
